## Introduction
Created by [Vladimir Chupakhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chupvl?_l=en_US), email at: [chupvl@gmail.com](mailto:chupvl@gmail.com). There are a lot of collaborations happening between pharma and biotech companies, all of them generate data in some form. The focus of the current awesome list is to list most interesting ones that are open to the public. This means that the data, code or frameworks are available for anyone to use, which can help to accelerate research and development in the biotech and pharma industry. The list was originally focused on a small molecules, but will be later expanded to clinical trials and .

## Criteria for inclusion:
- Open collaboration that is related to data generation or data sharing and involves >1 pharma/biotech partners
- Open collaboration results in data, code or documentation that can be reused for drug design and discovery process
- Data or ML algorithm development is of preference (e.g., a collaboration that establishes some legal standards is not of interest)
