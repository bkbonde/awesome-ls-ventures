## Introduction
Created by [Vladimir Chupakhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chupvl?_l=en_US), email at: [chupvl@gmail.com](mailto:chupvl@gmail.com).
The list contains industry ventures - biotech, pharma, and life science tech companies with centralized open code repositories working in a drug design and discovery field. Collection created with mostly Github as a primary search term, so other code platforms could be represented better. The section for the **big pharma** was based on the [top by revenue pharma companies in 2022](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/top-20-pharma-companies-2022-revenue) and [top 25 by R&D investment in 2022](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/top-pharma-rd-spenders-2022/), take into account a bit of a COVID19 bias. The **ML-first-companies** are usually a company started as a pure AI/ML that later converted to drug development in collaboration or internally; this list is based on my preferences and partially was improved by the list from the publication [AI in small-molecule drug discovery: a coming wave?](https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41573-022-00025-1/20096834). **Biotech companies** reprsent companies that started from a wet-lab platform but heavily using AI/ML for drug design and discovery process.

## Criteria for inclusion:
- Open code repository mostly of AI/ML focus
- Direct involvment in a drug design and discovery process
- I did not include: personal repositories of the company employees, and or course empty or suspicious repositories
