# Open code repositories of pharma and biotech companies

## Introduction
Created by [Vladimir Chupakhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chupvl?_l=en_US), email at: [chupvl@gmail.com](mailto:chupvl@gmail.com).
The list contains industry ventures - biotech, pharma, and life science tech companies with centralized open code repositories. Collection created with mostly Github as a primary search term, so other code platforms could be represented better. The list of big pharma was based on the [top by revenue pharma companies in 2022](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/top-20-pharma-companies-2022-revenue), so COVID19 biased that list and [top 25 by R&D investment in 2022](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/top-pharma-rd-spenders-2022/).
I did not include:
- Personal repositories of the company employees
- Empty or suspicious repositories (they are under [this section](#Companies that don't have centralized open code sharing).
